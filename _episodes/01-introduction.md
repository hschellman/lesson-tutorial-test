## DUNE Computing Consortium

The DUNE Computing Consortium works to establish a global computing network that will handle the massive data streams produced by distributing these across the computing grid.
Selected consortia members coordinate DUNE computing activities to new members to acquaint them with the specific and DUNE software and resources.

DUNE Computing Consortium Coordinator: Michael Kirby (Brookhave National Laboratory)

## Support

<!--
There will be live documents linked from [Indico][indico-event-link] for each [Zoom][zoom-link] session. You can write questions there, anonymously or not, and experts will reply. The chat on Zoom can quickly saturate so this is a more convenient solution and proved very successful at the previous training. We will collect all questions and release a Q&A after the event.
-->

You must be on the DUNE Collaboration member list and have a valid FNAL or CERN account. See the old [Indico Requirement page][indico-event-requirements] for more information. Windows users are invited to review the [Windows Setup page]({{ site.baseurl }}/Windows.html).

You should join the DUNE Slack instance and look in [#computing-training-basics](https://dunescience.slack.com/archives/C02TJDHUQPR) for help with this tutorial
