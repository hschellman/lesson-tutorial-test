<!--Temporary Note: The May 2023 version of the DUNE Software and Computing training was imported from the May 2022 version because it was a two day event, similar to this one, see [03-data-management.md (May 2022)](https://github.com/DUNE/computing-training-basics/blob/gh-pages/_episodes/03-data-management.md) for reference.

This lesson (03-data-management.md) was imported from the [Jan. 2023 lesson](https://github.com/DUNE/computing-training-basics-short/tree/gh-pages/_episodes) which was a shortened version of the training.

Quiz blocks are added in this lesson and should be administered in the closing minutes of this lesson. Feel free to modify or add quiz questions. Some of these quiz questions might be more appropriate for 02-storage-spaces.md -->

 

## Introduction

DUNE data is stored around the world and the storage elements are not always organized in a way that they can be easily inspected. For this purpose we use the metacat data catalog to describe the data and collections and rucio to determine where replicas of files are.  There is also a legacy SAM data access system that can be used for older files. 

### What is metacat

Metacat is a file catalog - it allows you to search for files that have particular attributes and understand their provenance, including details on all of their processing steps. 

You can find extensive documentation on metacat at:

[General metacat documentation](https://metacat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

[DUNE metacat examples](https://dune.github.io/DataCatalogDocs/index.html)

### Find a file in metacat

DUNE runs multiple experiments (far detectors, protodune-sp, protodune-dp hd-protodune, vd-protodune, iceberg, coldboxes... ) and produces various kinds of data (mc/detector) and process them through different phases.

To find your data you need to specify at the minimum 

- `core.run_type`  (the experiment)
- `core.file_type` (mc or detecor)
- `core.data_tier` (the level of processing raw, full-reconstructed, root-tuple)

and when searching for specific types of data

- `core.data_stream` (physics, calibration, cosmics)
- `core.runs[any]=<runnumber>`

 Here is an example of a metacat query that gets you raw files from a recent 'hd-protodune' cosmics run.

First get metacat if you have not already done so

~~~
setup metacat # if using SL7
spack load metacat # if using Alma9
metacat auth login -m password $USER  # use your services password to authenticate
export METACAT_AUTH_SERVER_URL=https://metacat.fnal.gov:8143/auth/dune
export METACAT_SERVER_URL=https://metacat.fnal.gov:9443/dune_meta_prod/app 
~~~
{: .language-bash}

>### Note: other means of authentication
>Check out the [metacat documentation](https://metacat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ui.html#user-authentication) for 
kx509 and token authentication. 
{: .callout}

then do queries to find particular sets of files. 
~~~
metacat query "files from dune:all where core.file_type=detector \
 and core.run_type=hd-protodune and core.data_tier=raw \
 and core.data_stream=cosmics and core.runs[any]=27296 limit 2"
~~~
{: .language-bash}

should give you 2 files:

~~~
hd-protodune:np04hd_raw_run027296_0000_dataflow3_datawriter_0_20240619T110330.hdf5
hd-protodune:np04hd_raw_run027296_0000_dataflow0_datawriter_0_20240619T110330.hdf5
~~~
{: .output}


the string before the ':' is the namespace and the string after is the filename.

You can find out more about your file by doing:

~~~
metacat file show -m -l hd-protodune:np04hd_raw_run027296_0000_dataflow3_datawriter_0_20240619T110330.hdf5
~~~
{: .language-bash}

which gives you a lot of information:

~~~

look in the glossary to see what those fields mean. 

### find out how much raw data there is in a run using the summary option

~~~
metacat query -s "files from dune:all where core.file_type=detector \
 and core.run_type=hd-protodune and core.data_tier=raw \
 and core.data_stream=cosmics and core.runs[any]=27296"
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
Files:        963
Total size:   4092539942264 (4.093 TB)
~~~
{: .output}

To look at all the files in that run you need to use XRootD - **DO NOT TRY TO COPY 4 TB to your local area!!!***



### What is(was) SAM?  
Sequential Access with Metadata (SAM) is/was a data handling system developed at Fermilab.  It is designed to tracklocations of files and other file metadata.  It has been replaced by metacat.  

<!--This lecture will show you how to access data files that have been defined to the DUNE Data Catalog. Execute the following commands after logging in to the DUNE interactive node, and sourcing the main dune setups.

Once per session:
~~~
setup sam_web_client
export SAM_EXPERIMENT=dune
~~~
-->

### What is Rucio?
Rucio is the next-generation Data Replica service and is part of DUNE's new Distributed Data Management (DDM) system that is currently in deployment. 
Rucio has two functions:
1. A rule-based system to get files to Rucio Storage Elements around the world and keep them there.
2. To return the "nearest" replica of any data file for use either in interactive or batch file use.  It is expected that most DUNE users will not be regularly using direct Rucio commands, but other wrapper scripts that calls them indirectly.

As of the date of the June 2024 tutorial:
- The Rucio client is available in CVMFS
- Most DUNE users are now enabled to use it. New users may not automatically be added. 

### Let's find a file

If you haven't already done this earlier in setup

- On sl7 type `setup rucio`
- On al9 type `spack load rucio-clients@33.3.0`  # may need to update that version #

~~~
# first get a kx509 proxy, then

export RUCIO_ACCOUNT=$USER


rucio list-file-replicas hd-protodune:np04hd_raw_run027296_0000_dataflow3_datawriter_0_20240619T110330.hdf5 --pfns --protocols=root
~~~
{: .language-bash}

returns 3 locations:

~~~
root://eospublic.cern.ch:1094//eos/experiment/neutplatform/protodune/dune/hd-protodune/e5/57/np04hd_raw_run027296_0000_dataflow3_datawriter_0_20240619T110330.hdf5
root://fndca1.fnal.gov:1094/pnfs/fnal.gov/usr/dune/tape_backed/dunepro//hd-protodune/raw/2024/detector/cosmics/None/00/02/72/96/np04hd_raw_run027296_0000_dataflow3_datawriter_0_20240619T110330.hdf5
root://eosctapublic.cern.ch:1094//eos/ctapublic/archive/neutplatform/protodune/rawdata/np04//hd-protodune/raw/2024/detector/cosmics/None/00/02/72/96/np04hd_raw_run027296_0000_dataflow3_datawriter_0_20240619T110330.hdf5
~~~
{: .output}


which is the locations of the file on disk and tape. We can use this to copy the file to our local disk or access the file via xroot. 

### Finding files by characteristics using metacat

To list raw data files for a given run:
~~~
metacat query "files where core.file_type=detector \
 and core.run_type='protodune-sp' and core.data_tier=raw \
 and core.data_stream=physics and core.runs[any] in (5141)"
~~~
{: .language-bash}

- `core.run_type` tells you which of the many DAQ's this came from. 
- `core.file_type` tells detector from mc
- `core.data_tier` could be raw, full-reconstructed, root-tuple.  Same data different formats. 

~~~
protodune-sp:np04_raw_run005141_0013_dl7.root
protodune-sp:np04_raw_run005141_0005_dl3.root
protodune-sp:np04_raw_run005141_0003_dl1.root
protodune-sp:np04_raw_run005141_0004_dl7.root
...
protodune-sp:np04_raw_run005141_0009_dl7.root
protodune-sp:np04_raw_run005141_0014_dl11.root
protodune-sp:np04_raw_run005141_0007_dl6.root
protodune-sp:np04_raw_run005141_0011_dl8.root
~~~
{: .output}

Note the presence of both a *namespace* and a *filename* 

What about some files from a reconstructed version?
~~~ 
metacat query "files from dune:all where core.file_type=detector \
 and core.run_type='protodune-sp' and core.data_tier=full-reconstructed  \
 and core.data_stream=physics and core.runs[any] in (5141) and dune.campaign=PDSPProd4 limit 10" 
~~~
{: .language-bash}

To see the total number of files that match a certain query expression, then add the `-s` option to `metacat query`.

<!---`samweb` allows you to select on a lot of parameters which are documented here:

* [Useful ProtoDUNE samweb parameters][useful-samweb]

* [dune-data.fnal.gov](https://dune-data.fnal.gov) lists some official dataset definitions

See the metacat documentation for more information about queries.  [DataCatalogDocs][DataCatalogDocs]  and check out the glossary of common fields at: [MetaCatGlossary][MetaCatGlossary]

## Accessing data for use in your analysis
To access data without copying it, `XRootD` is the tool to use. However it will work only if the file is staged to the disk.

You can stream files worldwide if you have a DUNE VO certificate as described in the preparation part of this tutorial.

To learn more about using Rucio and Metacat to run over large data samples go here:

> The [Justin/Rucio/Metacat Tutorial](https://docs.dunescience.org/cgi-bin/sso/RetrieveFile?docid=30145) 
>  and [justin tutorial](https://justin.dune.hep.ac.uk/docs/tutorials.dune.md)
{: .challenge}


> ## Exercise 1
> * Use `metacat` to find a file from a particular experiment/run/processing stage 
> * Use `metacat file show -m namespace:filename` to get  metadata for this file. Note that `--json` gives the output in json format.
{: .challenge}


When we are analyzing large numbers of files in a group of batch jobs, we use a metacat dataset to describe the full set of files that we are going to analyze and use the JustIn system to run over that dataset. Each job will then come up and ask metacat and rucio to give it the next file in the list. It will try to find the nearest copy.  For instance if you are running at CERN and analyzing this file it will automatically take it from the CERN storage space EOS.
